# Portfolio2-1
This is the first part of my portfolio, using lab 6.

Option 1.1: Extending Two Asignments, 3 Components each. This is part 1 of Portfolio 2 where I use lab 6.

New Components are all useState:

In DayNight.js I used the new component as part of a page that lets people know when there is Daylight or 
Darkness, letting them know when to be awake or asleep.

In LoginApp.js, I used the new component as part of a page which lets a user log in, along with error messages
to let the user know when information is inputted incorrectly.

In LoginHelp.js, I used the new component as a page to count how many times a user has inquired for help
due to issues logging into the page. Which displays a messgae using the component to let users know how
many times they have inquired, and how many emails they have recieved.
